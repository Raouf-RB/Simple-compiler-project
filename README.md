# Simple-compiler-project
The Mini Compiler Project is a simple compiler using Flex (Lex) for lexical analysis and Bison (Yacc) for syntax analysis. It parses and interprets custom language programs. Features include custom grammar with Bison, lexical analysis with Flex, and sample input/output files. Great for learning compiler basics.
